1. Write a program in C that, using the OpenSSL library, generates two 128 bit random strings. Then, it XOR them (bitwise) and prints the result on the standard output as an hex string.

2. Writes a program in C that, using the OpenSSL library, generates randomly the private key to be used for encrypting data with AES128 in CBC and the needed IV. Pay attention to select the proper PRNG.

3. Using OpenSSL, generate two 32 bit integers (int), multiply them (modulo 2^32) and print the result.

4. Using OpenSSL, generate two 256 bit integers, sum them (modulo 2^256) and print the result.
